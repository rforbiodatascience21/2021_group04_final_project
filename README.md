* The data used was generated at DTU Healthtech - Department of Experimental and translational immunology
* It is then proceeded to wrangling of data obtained from analysis of patient samples on the onset of Covid symptoms.
* The wrangled data are then plotted to compare the cell surface markers between patients to understand the changes of the immune cells during the phase of Covid.
