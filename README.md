# OVERVIEW
* The project utilizes flow cytometry data of immunophenotyping analysis on COVID-19 patient samples, which are then plotted to make analysis based on the changes in cell-surface markers expressed when the patient is infected with SARS-CoV2.
* The raw data set is an excel file exported from the analysis software FlowJo.
* The data used was generated at DTU Health Tech - Department of Experimental and Translational Immunology.
* The wrangled data is then plotted to compare the cell surface markers between different patients to understand the changes of the immune cells during the phase of COVID-19.
* Here we compare the immune profiles of patients who were hospitalized and those who were not hospitalized with those of healthy individuals.
