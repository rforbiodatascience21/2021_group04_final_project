# OVERVIEW
* The project utilizes data of immuno phenotyping analysis on Covid patient samples (flow cytometry data), which are then plotted to make analysis based on the changes in cell-surface markers expressed when the patient is infected with SARS-Cov2.  
* The data used was generated at DTU Healthtech - Department of Experimental and translational immunology.
* It is then proceeded to wrangling of data obtained from analysis of patient samples on the onset of Covid symptoms.
* The wrangled data is then plotted to compare the cell surface markers between different patients to understand the changes of the immune cells during the phase of Covid.
* Here we compare the immune profiles of patients who were hospitalized and throse who were not hospitalized with those of healthy individuals
